This project features a "Connect Wallet" button that enables users to connect to their favorite wallet the Polygon network. In a production environment, it connects to the Polygon mainnet, while in non-production environments it connects to the Polygon Mumbai Testnet.
After successfully connecting to wallet, users' wallet address will be displayed, and user can click on the address to view it in the Chain Explorer. Additionally, user can disconnect from the wallet by pressing the "Disconnectâ€¦" button.

I assume that the user is familiar with cloning GitHub repositories, setting up, and executing Next.js projects.
